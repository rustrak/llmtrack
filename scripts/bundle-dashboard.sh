# Put the compiled dashboard where the server looks for it.
#
# `apps/dashboard` builds to its own `dist/` -- that is the directory Turbo
# caches, and a task whose output lands in another package would be cached
# under the wrong key. So the copy is a separate, explicit step: the dashboard
# owns `dist/`, the server owns `static/`, and this script is the seam.
#
# `./static` is what `LLMTRACK_DASHBOARD_DIR` defaults to, resolved against the
# working directory, so `cargo run` from `apps/server` finds it with no
# configuration at all.
#
# Missing build is not an error. The server is a complete product without a UI,
# and `cargo build` alone must keep working for anyone who never installs Node.
