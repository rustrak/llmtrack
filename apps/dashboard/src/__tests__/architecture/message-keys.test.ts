/**
 * The message dictionaries can drift apart in three ways, and each one
 * rendered a `MISSING_MESSAGE` error in the browser before this suite
 * existed:
 *
 *  1. a key used in code that was never added to the JSON at all
 *     (`commands.close` was called by the command-bar footer and missing
 *     from both locales),
 *  2. a key added to `en` but not `es` (use-intl renders the key name),
 *  3. a key nested under the wrong namespace, so `useTranslations('x')`
 *     plus `t('y.z')` resolves `x.y.z` which does not exist (`roles.*`
 *     was stored at the top level while the header resolved it through the
 *     `user` namespace).
 *
 * The suite below checks all three statically, over the real source files.
 * The namespace resolution is deliberately simple: a file's hook decides
 * the prefix, and a `t()` call that carries its own full path (global
 * `useTranslations()` or a model-emitted `labelKey`) is resolved as-is.
 * That matches how the code actually calls the translator.
